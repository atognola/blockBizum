/**
 * Implements the registry for address => name mapping
 * This registry pattern contract is used by thedapps.com for personalizing the user experience
 * 
 * The following work is based upon the pattern_address_registry.sol contract
 *
 * Functional analysis of the pattern:
 * This contract pattern implements a "phone book" (registry) of sorts for the Ethereum network
 * Different pieces of information can be stored in a struct which is associated to an address in the network.
 *
 * Use case:
 * For the scope of this assignment, I will create a Blockchain based Bizum alternative.
 * Users will be able to register their personal information (Name and Phone number).
 * Other users will be able to wire money to these users while only needing to know their friend's phone number!
 * User registering must provide a unique phone number which is assigned on a first come, first served basis.
 * Ideally, some phone number validation would be needed for the user registration.
 * Finally, user's names can be non unique, and will be used only as a confirmation to whoever 
 * sent the payment in the first place
 * 
 * Pattern: Mapping Iteration
